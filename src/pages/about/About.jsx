      <h3>My Story</h3>

      <p>
        I began crafting jewely as a hobbist but it evolved into a successful
        online jewelry store. The name "Legendary Gemstone" was inspired by my
        mom who filt that each stone had a unique beauty and its own story to
        tell. "Legendary Gemstone" describes the goal of the company which is to
        always make the gemstone a prominent feature in each design. The name
        stuck and the company launched in January, 2010.
