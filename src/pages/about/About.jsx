      <p>
        At Legendary Gemstone, I offer a variety of jewelry, including
        necklaces, earrings and rings. Each piece of jewelry is uniquely
        handcrafts by me, TaLoveous. Each design is made using carefully
        hand-picked gemstones and other precious materials. I integrate quality
        and durability in each design, while highlighting the unqiue shape and
        earthy tone of the gemstone. With Legendary Gemstone customers can
        always expect expressive, timeless, and versatile jewelry that is simple
        enough to wear every day and perfect for special occasions!

      <h3>My Story</h3>

      <p>
        I began crafting jewely as a hobbist and this led to home jewelry
        parties in the homes of friends and family. Shortly afterwards in Janary of 2010, I launched
        an online jewelry store that I named "Legendary Gemstone". The name was
        inspired by my mom who believed that each
        gemstone had a unique beauty and story to tell. My mom's words
        best describe the goal of "Legendary Gemstone", to always make the
        gemstone a prominent feature in each design. The name stuck and the
        online company launched in January, 2010.
